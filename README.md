[Property Location Expert](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-dcOOpiQPR-property-location-expert) was created to assist users in evaluating, planning, and simulating potential property locations for personal or professional use. Its primary function is to help users assess different factors that influence the suitability of a location for their needs, including accessibility, proximity to amenities, zoning regulations, environmental concerns, and future development opportunities. Whether a user is considering residential, commercial, or industrial property, this GPT provides guidance by offering insights into aspects like local infrastructure, neighborhood trends, and the long-term value of the location.

The tool operates through a structured, step-by-step process, asking users key questions to clarify their preferences and needs. This helps refine the search for a property location based on specific criteria, such as the type of property being sought, climate considerations, or nearby services. While it can offer general guidance and recommendations, it does not provide legal advice or replace real estate professionals, lawyers, or zoning authorities. Instead, it aids in exploring options and gathering information, empowering users to make informed decisions in their property search.
